# Homebrew formula for lifeastro-mcp.
#
# Two distribution paths from this single file:
#
#  1. Tap from THIS repo (immediate):
#       brew tap ayanshulife/lifeastroapi-mcp https://github.com/ayanshulife/lifeastroapi-mcp
#       brew install lifeastro-mcp
#
#  2. Promote to the official homebrew-core later for `brew install lifeastro-mcp`
#     without a tap. Requires a stable release history first (per Homebrew's
#     audit policy: 30 days + GitHub stars threshold).
#
# Maintainer release flow when cutting `v0.3.1`:
#   1. git tag v0.3.1 && git push origin v0.3.1
#   2. Wait for the GitHub Actions release workflow to publish binaries
#      + checksums.txt at the Release URL.
#   3. Update `version` below.
#   4. Update each `sha256` from dist/lifeastro-mcp-checksums.txt.
#   5. Commit + push. Users `brew upgrade lifeastro-mcp` picks it up.
#
# Why a binary formula (not source build)?
#  - The MCP server is pure Go and the release pipeline already
#    cross-compiles to every supported triple. Distributing pre-built
#    bottles avoids requiring Go on the user's machine and is faster
#    (sub-second `brew install`).
#  - Homebrew binary formulae are first-class — both `cask`-style
#    (apps) and `formula`-style (CLIs) support shipping pre-built
#    artifacts via `url` + `sha256`.
